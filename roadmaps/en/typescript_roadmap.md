# TypeScript Learning Roadmap

## 1. Core Topics
- What is TypeScript? Advantages
- Setup and Environment Configuration
- Basic Types (number, string, boolean, etc.)
- Arrays and Tuples
- Enums
- Type Inference
- Type Annotation
- Functions and Function Types
- Union and Intersection Types
- Type Alias
- Literal Types
- Null, Undefined, Never, Unknown, Any

## 2. Intermediate Topics
- Interfaces
- Interface vs Type Alias
- Optional and Readonly Properties
- Function Overloading
- Type Narrowing
- Type Guards
- Type Assertion
- Modules and Export/Import
- Namespaces

## 3. Advanced Topics
- Generics
- Generic Constraints
- Mapped Types
- Conditional Types
- Utility Types (Partial, Pick, Omit, Record, etc.)
- Advanced Type Inference
- Template Literal Types
- Recursive Types
- Declaration Merging
- Advanced Intersection & Union Patterns

## 4. Real-World and Additional Topics
- Object-Oriented Programming with TypeScript (Classes, Inheritance, Abstract, etc.)
- Decorators
- Using TypeScript with React/Angular/Vue
- Third-Party Type Definitions (DefinitelyTyped/@types)
- Project Configuration (tsconfig.json)
- Linting and Formatting (TSLint, ESLint)
- Build Processes (Webpack, tsc, Babel integration)
- Writing Tests with TypeScript (Jest, Mocha, etc.)
- TypeScript and API Integration (Fetch, Axios types)
- TypeScript with Node.js

## 5. Advanced and Enterprise-Level Topics
- Advanced tsconfig.json settings (paths, baseUrl, composite, incremental, references)
- Monorepo management (Yarn Workspaces, Lerna, Nx with TypeScript)
- Library development and dts file generation
- Integration with Rollup, esbuild, SWC
- Type-safe APIs with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Runtime type validation (Zod, io-ts, Yup)
- Using TypeScript with Next.js, NestJS, Express, Fastify
- Type management in SSR/SSG projects
- State management (Redux Toolkit, Zustand, MobX with type safety)
- Form management (React Hook Form, Formik with typed forms)
- Internationalization (i18n, l10n with typed translation systems)
- Compile time and performance optimizations
- Type complexity and compiler limits
- Secure input/validation with types
- Safe third-party integrations
- Typed mocks, test utils, and type usage in e2e tests
- Automated type checking and coverage in CI/CD pipelines
- Generating documentation with Typedoc
- Using JSDoc and TSDoc
- Typed refactoring and migration strategies in large projects

## 6. Community and Ecosystem
- DefinitelyTyped and @types packages
- TypeScript RFCs and upcoming features
- Community tools and plugins
- Contributing to open source with TypeScript
